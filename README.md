# client-node

**client-node:** A TiKV client in Node.js.

This project was bootstrapped by [create-neon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-neon).

## Installing client-node

Installing client-node requires a [supported version of Node and Rust](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon#platform-support).

You can install the project with npm. In the project directory, run:

```sh
$ npm install
```

This fully installs the project, including installing any dependencies and running the build.

## Building client-node

If you have already installed the project and only want to run the build, run:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

This command uses the [cargo-cp-artifact](https://github.com/neon-bindings/cargo-cp-artifact) utility to run the Rust build and copy the built library into `./index.node`.

## Exploring client-node

After building client-node, you can explore its exports at the Node REPL:

```sh
$ npm install
$ node examples/raw_app.js
v1
v2
v3
[ [ 'k3', 'v3' ], [ 'k6', 'v6' ] ]
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the project, including running `npm run build`.

### `npm build`

Builds the Node addon (`index.node`) from source.

### `npm test`

Runs the unit tests by calling `cargo test`. You can learn more about [adding tests to your Rust code](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html) from the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
